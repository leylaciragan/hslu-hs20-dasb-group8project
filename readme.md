## About data preprocessing
Some of the preprocessing steps were performed using python scripts.
      
* The scripts are stored in a separate folder called *scripts*.
* To run the script, copy them into the main folder. The paths are set to be run from there.

## About data quality assessment
For some of the source data, a quality assessment was performed using python in a jupyter notebook.  

            
* Both the jupypter notebooks and the associated html reports are stored in a seperate folder called *quality_assessment*. 
* To view the report, open the html file.
